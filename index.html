    <h2>About me....</h2>
    <p>
      I am a person who chooses to be happy and joyful. No need for drama unless it's used for a valid tool for growth and experience. I am an artist. I choose dance as my median and currently adding coding to that. I love music and its inspiring magical qualities ( such as bjork, ani, tribal, beats, sounds of the ocean, and club). I motto is Trust, Communication, and Respect. Everything else stems from those. I am an intense WELCOMING person. I acknowledge the energy within every molecule(myself included), which causes me to live my life smoothly (but spunky),energetically (but with room for some defined Chillin), courageous and strongly, and totally perceptive (but can often be caught having absolutely NO clue what's going on).
    </p>
    <p>My new pursuit in coding has both a professional and personal goal. Professional, I would like to be part of this ever growing field. Technology is no longer this thing only for computer science majors and mathematicians but our everyday life. From cell phone, apps, watches, Alexa and so much more technology is becoming an everyday desire and need. I would like to be apart of this new renaissance. Help make the world a little better for everyone. </p>

    <p>On a personal level I would love to get into combining technology and dance. Specially drone. I like to create dance piece were the dancer and drone dance organically to together. Something like <a href="https://youtu.be/6C8OJsHfmpI">Cirque du Solei</a> did. I constantly hear how technology is destroying human interaction. But I believe it can bring us closer. I hope to express that through combining my to favorite things. </p>
    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. doing their Ruby Track. Right now am doing the Intro section of the Ruby trach but have done some project</p>
    <h3>Epicodus projects</h3>

    <h3>Hello World</h3>
    <p>The first thing most coders learn how to do is say hello to the world just using html.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/ElreyB/hello-world.git">Hello World!</a>

    <h3>First Webpage</h3>
    <p>Next step is to make it <em>pretty</em> using html and styling it with css.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/ElreyB/my-first-webpage.git">My First website</a>

    <h3>Our Wiki</h3>
    <p>Here we learn how to include bootstrap framework to our site. Here we re-created a Wikipedia page</p>

    <h2>Interests and Hoobies</h2>
    <p>As I breifly mention before, I dance. Well, use to dance professionally for about 14 years. I can go on and on about dacne and how it has shaped the person I am today but it my be more fun to checkout my dance website the my husband, Oscar Bartra, made for me.
